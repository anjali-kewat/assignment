Explain its purpose and usage.\n\n\"\"\" A constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.THe purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attribute or properties of the object.\nPurpose --->\n- The primary purpose is to set initial value for the attribute of the object.\n-It allows you to assign values to instance variables based on the arguments provided during object creation.\n\nUsage --->\n- It takes self as its first parameter and can take additional parameters to set initial values for attributes.\n-The constructor is automatically called when an object is created.\n-It allows you to customize the initialization process for each object.You can pass different values as arguments during object creation to  create objects with distinct initial states.\"\"\"\n#2. Differentiate between a parameterless constructor and a parameterized constructor in Python.\n\"\"\" Parameterless --->\n-It does not take any parameters.It is defines without any input parameters.\n-It intializes the object with default values .\n\nParameterized constructor --->\n-It takes one or more parameters.\n-It allows you to pass values during object instantiation .\n-It facilitates customization .\"\"\"\n\n\n#3. How do you define a constructor in a Python class? Provide an example.\n\n'''class Person:\n    def __init__(self,name,age):\n        self.name = name \n        self.age = age \n\nperson1 = Person(\"arru\",34)\nprint(person1.name)\n#4. Explain the `__init__` method in Python and its role in constructors.\n\n\"\"\" The name __init__ stands for initialize and it is automatically called when an object of the class is created.\nrole-\n- The __init__ method is the constructor of the class.It plays a crucial role in setting up the initial state of an object.\n-It allows you to customize the initialization process by accepting parameters and using them to set the initial values of the object's attributes.\"\"\"\n#5. In a class named `Person`, create a constructor that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes. Provide an example of creating an object of this class.\n\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self,name,age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\nperson2 = Person(\"Agni\",23)\nprint(person2.age)\n#6. How can you call a constructor explicitly in Python? Give an example.\n\nclass Myclass:\n    def __init__(self,value):\n        self.value = value \n    \n    def custom_initialization(self,new_value):\n        print(\"performing custom initialization\")\n        self.value = new_value\n\nobj = Myclass(10)\nprint(obj.value)\n\nobj.custom_initialization(20)\nprint(obj.value)\n#7. What is the significance of the `self` parameter in Python constructors? Explain with an example.\n\n\"\"\" Self parameter in a constructor is a  reference to the instance of the class .\nIt is a convention ,not a keyword ,and you can choose any name for this parameter,but self is widely used and considered good practice.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass computer:\n    def __init__(self,computername):\n        self.computername = computername\n\ncomp1 = computer(\"laptop\")\nprint(comp1.computername)\n#8. Discuss the concept of default constructors in Python. When are they used?\n\n\"\"\" Default constructor refers to the constructor that is automatically provided by pythom if a class does not explicitly define one .\n\nUses --\n- Default constructors are useful when you want to create instances of a class without needing to provide any initializes value explicitly\"\"\"\n\nclass Myclass:\n    pass\n\nobj1 = Myclass()\n#9.

How can you have multiple constructors in a Python class? Explain with an example.\n\n\"\"\" A class typically has a single constructor ,the __init__ method .\nHowever, you can achieve a similar effect to having multiple constructors by using default parameter values or by using class methods.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass rectangle:\n    def __init__(self,width =None,height =None):\n        self.width =width\n        self.height =height\n    \n    def calculate_area(self):\n        if self.width is not None and self.height is not None:\n            return self.width *self.height\n        else:\n            return \"width and height must be provided to calculate area.\"\n\nrec2 = rectangle(6,8)\narea1 = rec2.calculate_area()\nprint(f\"Area of rectangle : {area1}\") \n#11. What is method overloading, and how is it related to constructors in Python?\n\n\"\"\"Overloading - It refers to the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name  but  different parameter lists .\nIt provides an alternative way to instantiate object with a simplified parameter list .\"\"\"\n#12. Explain the use of the `super()` function in Python constructors.

Discuss the differences between constructors and regular methods in Python classes.\n\n\"\"\"Constructor --\n- The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes or properties of an object when it is created .\n- The constructor is automatically  called when an object is creted .\n-The constructor has a specific name ,__init__ and it is automatically recognized by python  as the method to be called when an object is created .\n\nRegulat Method -\n- It perform various actions or operations on objects .\n-It is called  explicitly on an object . You need to reference the object and call the method .\n-It can have any valid name on the object .\n-It return the values based on their functionality.\n \"\"\"\n#15. Explain the role of the `self` parameter in instance variable initialization within a constructor.\n\n\"\"\" When initializing instance variable within a constructors ,you use 'self' to asspciate those variables within the specific instance being created . This ensures that each instance of the class has its own set of variables,preventing conflicts between different instance.\"\"\"\n#16. How do you prevent a class from having multiple instances by using constructors in Python? Provide an example.\n\n\"\"\"To prevent a class from having multiple instances,you can use a class variable to keep track of wheather an instance has already been created .By raising an exception if an attempt is made to create a second instance,you enforce the restriction .\"\"\"\n\nclass singletonclass:\n    _instance_created= False\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        if singletonclass._instance_created:\n            raise ValueError (\"An instance of singleton class already exists .use getinstance() to get the instance.\")\n        else:\n            singletonclass._instance_created = True\n\nsingleton_instance = singletonclass()\n\n#second_instance =singletonclass()\n#17.

What is the purpose of the `__del__` method in Python classes, and how does it relate to constructors?\n\n\"\"\" The __del__ method is a special method that is called when an object is about to destroyed .\nIt is used for  cleanup and releasing resources associated with an object is about to de destroyed \n\n-The __del__ is used to delete an object  and it does not directly relate to constructors __init__ responsible for initializing the attribute of an object when it is created.\n\"\"\"\n#19. Explain the use of constructor chaining in Python. Provide a practical example.\n\"\"\" Constructor chaining in python refers to the concept of calling one constructor from another within the same class.\nThis allows you to reuse cide and avoid redundancy when intializing objects with similar or related attributes.\"\"\"\n\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self,name,age,):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age \n\n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"Name :{self.name},Age :{self.age}\")\n\nclass student(Person):\n    def __init__(self,name,age,student_id):\n        super().__init__(name,age)\n        self.student_id = student_id\n\n    def display_student_info(self):\n        self.display_info()\n        print(f\"student Id : {self.student_id}\")\n\nstudent1 =student(\"Agni\",20,\"S1234\")\nstudent1.display_student_info()\n          \n\n    \n\n#20.

What is inheritance in Python? Explain its significance in object-oriented programming.\n\"\"\" Inheritance - It allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\nTHe class that is inherit from is called parent class and the class that inherits is called the child or derived class .\n\nSignificance - \n- Inheritance allows a child class to reuse the code of its parent class .The child class automatically gains the acess to the attributes and method of the parent class.\n-Child class can extend or override the behaviour of the parent class .This means you can add new functionality or modifying existing behaviour in a child class without modifying parent class .\n-It is closely tied to polymorphism ,which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n\"\"\"\n\n#2. Differentiate between single inheritance and multiple inheritance in Python. Provide examples for each.\n\n\"\"\" Single inheritance -->\n-In single inheritance a class can inherit from only one parent class .\nTHe class hierarchy form a linear structure .\nIt simplifies the design and is generally less complex .\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\nMultiple inheritance ---->\n- In multiple inheritance a class can inherit from more than one parent class .\n-The class hierarchy forms a more complex often diamond shaped structure .\nIt allows the child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources .\n\"\"\"\nclass parent:\n       def p(self):\n           pass\n#single inheritance \nclass child(parent):\n       pass\n#multiple inheritance \n    \nclass parent1:\n    \n    def pp(self):\n        pass\n\nclass parent2:\n     \n     def pp2(self):\n         pass\n     \nclass child(parent1,parent2):\n      pass\n\n\n\n\n#3.

Provide an example of creating a `Car` object.\n\nclass vehicle:\n\n    def __init__(self,color,speed):\n        self.color = color \n        self.speed = speed\n\n\nclass Car(vehicle):\n\n    def __init__(self,color,speed,brand):\n        super().__init__(color,speed)\n        self.brand = brand\n\ncar = Car( color =\"red\" ,speed = 120, brand =\"Toyota\")\nprint(f\" Color : {car.color}\")\nprint(f\"Speed :{car.speed}\")\nprint(f\"Brand :{car.brand}\")\n\n#4. Explain the concept of method overriding in inheritance. Provide a practical example.\n\n\"\"\" Method overriding is a concept in oops where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its  superclass.\nThe overridden method in the subclass has the same signature as the method in the superclass.\"\"\"\n\nclass Animal:\n    def make_sound(self):\n        return \"Generic animal sound \"\n    \nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def make_sound(self):\n        return \"bark bark\"\n    \nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def make_sound(self):\n        return  \"meow meow\"\n    \ngeneric_animal =Animal()\ndog = Dog()\ncat = Cat()\n\nprint(generic_animal.make_sound())\nprint(dog.make_sound())\nprint(cat.make_sound())\n\n\n#5. How can you access the methods and attributes of a parent class from a child class in Python? Give an example.\n\n\"\"\" You can acess the methods and attributes of a parent class from a child class using the super () function. \nThe super() function provides a way to refer to the parent class and invoke its method .\"\"\"\n\nclass parent:\n    def __init__(self,name):\n        self.name = name \n\n    def greet(self):\n        return f\"Hello,I am {self.name}\"\n    \nclass child(parent):\n    def __init__(self,name,hobby):\n        super().__init__(name)\n        self.hobby = hobby\n\n    def introduce(self):\n\n        parent_greet = super().greet()\n        return f'{parent_greet} and I love {self.hobby}'\n    \nchild_obj = child(name =\"AAru\",hobby=\"making videos\")\n\nprint(child_obj.greet())\nprint(child_obj.introduce())\nprint(child_obj.name)\nprint(child_obj.hobby)\n#6.

What is the \"diamond problem\" in multiple inheritance, and how does Python address it?\n\n\"\"\"Diamond problem --\nThe diamond problem occur in programming language that support multiple inheritance when a partocular class is derived from two classes that have a common ancestor .\nThis create ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy ,as there are multiple paths for the derived class to inherit the same method or attribute .\n\nSolution -- \n\nIt is adresses through  a mechanism called  C3 linearization .Python uses the C3 lineraization algorithm to establish a consistent order in which base classes are considered during method resolution .\nThis ensures that ambiguity is resolved and the method or attribute is inherited from a specific class in a predictable manner. \"\"\"\n#19. Discuss the concept of \"is-a\" and \"has-a\" relationships in inheritance, and provide examples of each.\n\n\"\"\" Is a Relationship ---->\n\n-This relationship is typically represented by inheritance .

Explain the concept of encapsulation in Python. What is its role in object-oriented programming?\n\n\"\"\"Encapsulation is one of fundamental concepts in oops and is often associated with the idea if bundling data and the method that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.\nIt is achieved through the use of classes and acess modifiers.\nIt is basically hiding the details from user .\"\"\"\n# 2. Describe the key principles of encapsulation, including access control and data hiding.\n\n\"\"\"Encapsulation is a key principle in OOP that involve bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.\nThe main objective of encapsulation are to provide a way to control acess to the internal details of a class and to hide the complexity of its implementation.\n\n1.Acess control --->\n-PUBLIC --  members of a class are public by default ,meaning they can be acessed from outside the class.\nThis is the least restrictive level of acess.\n\nProtected acess - Members marked as protected are accesible within the class and its subclasses.\nThis level of acess is indicated by a single underscore prefix.\n\nPrivate acess - Members marked as private are only accessible within the class itself.\nThis level of access is indicated by a double underscore prefix.\n\n2.Data hiding - Encapsulation involves hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world.\nThe internal state of the class should not be directly accessible or modifable from external code.\n\n-Instead of direct acessing or modifying attributes ,encapsulation encourages the use of getter and setter methods.\nThese methods provide controlled acess to the internal state of the class,allowing validation or additional logic to be applied.\n\n \"\"\"\n# 3. How can you achieve encapsulation in Python classes? Provide an example.\n\n\"\"\" Encapsulation in python classes can be achieved through a combinations of access modifiers and conventions.\nPython provide acess modifiers in the form of single and double underscore to indicate the level of access control.\n\"\"\"\n#public Members - \n\nclass Myclass:\n    def __init__(self,data):\n        self.data = data\n\n    def process_data(self):\n          pass\n\nclass Myclass:\n    def __init__(self,data):\n        self._data =data\n    def  _process_data(self):\n         pass\n#private method-\n\nclass Myclass:\n    def __init__(self,data):\n        self.__data =data\n\n    def __process_data(self):\n          pass\n\n\n# 4. Discuss the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers in Python.\n\n\"\"\"Public - \n-No underscore prefix \n-Members are acessible from anywhere ,both within the class and from outside the class.\n\nProtected - \n- Single underscore prefix conventially indicates protected access.\n-Members are acessible within the class and its subclass.\nThey can still be acesses from outside the class.\n\"\"\"\n# 5.

Discuss the use of accessors and mutators in encapsulation. How do they help maintain control over attribute access?\n\n\"\"\" Accessors and mutators commonly known as getter and setter, are methods used in object oriented programming to control access to the attrubute of a class.\nThey play a crucial role in implementating incapsulation by providing a way to interact with and manipulate the internal state of an object while maintaining control over attribute acess.\n\n\nBenefits -->\n1.control acess -\n-Accessors and mutators allow developers to define how internal attribute are accessed and modified .\nThis ensures that access to sensitive data is controlled promoting encapsulation\n\n2.Validation and Logic \n-By using mutators,developers can incorporate validations logic before allowing changes to private attributes .This helps maintain the integrity of the object's state and prevents invalid or  unitended modifications.\n\n3.Abstraction \n-Accessors and mutators provide a level of abstraction by hiding the internal detail of attribute access.\n\n4.Flexibility \n- Since acess to attributes is mediated through methods,changes to the internal representations of attributes can be made without affecting the external code that uses the class.\n\"\"\"\n# 16.

Explain how encapsulation enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs.\n\n\"\"\" Code Reusaility\n1.Encapsulation as a Black Box:\n\nEncapsulation allows you to treat an object as a \"black box\" where the internal details are hidden. Users of the class don't need to know how the object is implemented internally; they only need to interact with its public interface.\n2.Reuse Without Understanding Implementation:\n\n-Encapsulation enables the reuse of code without understanding its internal workings. If a class provides a well-defined interface (public methods), it can be reused in different parts of the program or even in different projects without users having to know the details of its implementation.\n3.Library and Module Development:\n\nEncapsulation encourages the development of libraries and modules. A well-designed class can be packaged as a module or a library, making it easy for other developers to import and use it in their projects. This promotes the reuse of code across different applications.\n4.Inheritance and Polymorphism:\n\nEncapsulation works hand in hand with inheritance and polymorphism. Subclasses can inherit the attributes and methods of a base class, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class, facilitating interchangeable use.\n\n\nModularity:\n1.Clear Separation of Concerns:\n\nEncapsulation promotes a clear separation of concerns by organizing code into modular units (classes). Each class encapsulates a specific set of functionalities related to a particular concept or entity, making the code more modular and easier to manage.\n2.Ease of Maintenance:\n\nModules encapsulate related functionality, making it easier to locate and modify code. When a change is required, developers can focus on the specific module or class without affecting the rest of the program. This enhances code maintainability.\n3.Reduced Complexity:\n\nBy encapsulating details within classes, the overall complexity of the program is reduced. Modules with well-defined interfaces and limited interactions provide a higher level of abstraction, making the code more understandable and easier to reason about.\n4.Isolation of Changes:\nChanges to the internal implementation of a class do not affect the code that uses the class, as long as the public interface remains consistent. This isolation of changes ensures that modifications can be made within a module without causing ripple effects throughout the entire codebase.\"\"\"\n# 19. Describe the concept of information hiding in encapsulation. Why is it essential in software development?\n\"\"\"\nKEY ASPECT OF INFORMATION HIDING-\n1.Private Implementation Details:\nInformation hiding ensures that the internal implementation details of an object, such as its data members or methods, are kept private. This means that the internal workings are not exposed to external code.\n\n2.Public Interface:\nOnly a specific set of methods, known as the public interface, is made accessible to external code. This interface defines how external entities can interact with the object. The public interface is designed to be stable and resistant to changes in the internal implementation.\n3.Abstraction:\nInformation hiding promotes abstraction by allowing users to interact with objects at a higher level without being concerned about the low-level details. Abstraction simplifies the complexity of a system, making it easier to understand and use.\n\n4.Reduced Complexity and Coupling:\nBy hiding unnecessary details, information hiding reduces the complexity of an object and minimizes the dependencies between different parts of a program. This results in lower coupling, meaning that changes in one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts.\n\n\nWhy Information Hiding is Essential in Software Development:\n1.Security and Privacy:\nInformation hiding enhances security by protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. Private details, such as passwords or internal algorithms, are shielded from external entities.\n\n2.Maintainability:\nEncapsulation with information hiding improves maintainability. Changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting the external code as long as the public interface remains unchanged. This isolation of changes simplifies maintenance efforts.\n\n3.Flexibility and Evolution:\nInformation hiding allows for more flexible and evolvable software. The internal details of an object can evolve over time without impacting external code. This supports the long-term sustainability of software systems.\n\n4.Encapsulation and Modularity:\nInformation hiding is a fundamental aspect of encapsulation, contributing to modularity. Encapsulated modules can be treated as independent units, allowing developers to focus on specific components without being burdened by unnecessary details.\n\n5.Team Collaboration:\nIn a collaborative development environment, information hiding facilitates teamwork. Developers can work on different modules concurrently, and as long as the public interfaces are adhered to, integration issues are minimized.\n\n6.Reduction of Complexity:\nBy providing a simplified view of an object's functionality through its public interface, information hiding reduces the cognitive load on developers. It allows them to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves it.\"\"\"\n# 20.

Explain the concept of abstract classes in Python and how they are defined using the `abc` module. Provide an example.\n\n\"\"\"In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for a group of related classes, and they often contain abstract methods that must be implemented by their subclasses. Abstract classes provide a way to enforce a certain structure in the subclasses, ensuring that they implement specific methods.\n\nThe abc module in Python provides the tools to create abstract base classes (ABCs). The ABC (Abstract Base Class) is a metaclass that allows you to define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator.\"\"\"\n#5. How do abstract classes differ from regular classes in Python? Discuss their use cases.\n\"\"\"\n\nAbstract classes in Python differ from regular classes in that they cannot be instantiated on their own, and they often include abstract methods that must be implemented by their subclasses. Here are key differences and use cases for abstract classes compared to regular classes:\n\nAbstract Classes:\n1.Instantiation:\n\nAbstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They are meant to be subclassed, and instances are created from the concrete subclasses.\n2.Abstract Methods:\n\nAbstract classes often include one or more abstract methods, which are methods without a defined implementation. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n3.Use of abc Module:\n\nAbstract classes are typically defined using the abc module in Python. The ABC (Abstract Base Class) metaclass and the @abstractmethod decorator are commonly used to create abstract classes and abstract methods.\n4.Enforcement of Structure:\n\nAbstract classes are used to enforce a certain structure in subclasses. They define a common interface that subclasses must adhere to, ensuring a consistent implementation across multiple related classes.\n5.Polymorphism:\n\nAbstract classes play a significant role in achieving polymorphism. Objects of different subclasses can be treated as objects of the abstract class type, allowing for a more generalized and flexible code design.\n6.Examples:\n\nExamples of abstract classes include a generic Shape class with an abstract method calculate_area(), or an Animal class with abstract methods for make_sound() and move().\n\nRegular Classes:\n\n1.Instantiation:\n\nRegular classes can be instantiated directly. Objects are created from regular classes without the need for subclassing.\n2.Concrete Methods:\n\nRegular classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. Concrete methods have defined implementations and provide specific functionalities.\n3.No abc Module Usage:\n\nRegular classes do not necessarily rely on the abc module. They can be defined without using abstract methods or the ABC metaclass.\n4.Flexibility:\n\nRegular classes provide flexibility in terms of structure and implementation. They may or may not have a predefined structure for subclasses to follow.\n.Polymorphism:\n\nWhile regular classes can also be used in polymorphic scenarios, they do not enforce a common interface in the same way as abstract classes. Polymorphism with regular classes often relies on shared method names and behaviors.\n6.Examples:\n\nExamples of regular classes include a Car class with concrete methods for start_engine() and drive(), or a Person class with concrete methods for say_hello() and walk().\n\nUse Cases:\n1.Abstract Classes:\n\nUse abstract classes when you want to define a common interface that must be implemented by multiple related classes.\nWhen you want to enforce a certain structure and behavior in subclasses.\nWhen you want to achieve polymorphism by treating objects of different subclasses as objects of a common base type.\n\n2.Regular Classes:\n\nUse regular classes when you need to create standalone objects with specific functionalities.\nWhen you don't need to enforce a specific structure across subclasses.\nWhen you want a class to be instantiated directly without the need for subclassing.\"\"\"\n#6.

Discuss the concept of interface classes in Python and their role in achieving abstraction.\n\n\"\"\"Interface classes are a form of abstraction that allows you to define a contract for classes without providing any implementation .Interface classes play a crucial role in achieving abstraction by specyfying a set of method signature that concrete classes must implement .\nWhile python does not have a built in suntax for explicity defining interfaces,the concept often implementaed using abstract base classes and abstract  method .\n\nKEY CONCEPT \n1.Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):\n\nAbstract base classes in Python are used to define abstract methods, which are methods without a defined implementation. Abstract methods are declared in an abstract base class using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n2.Interface Classes:\n\nInterface classes are essentially abstract base classes that declare a set of methods without providing any implementation. They define a contract that concrete classes must adhere to by implementing these methods.\n3.Enforcing a Contract:\n\nInterface classes provide a way to enforce a contract between classes. Concrete classes that claim to implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the interface.\n\n\nAchieving Abstraction with Interface Classes:\n1.Common Method Signatures:\n\nInterface classes specify common method signatures that participating classes must implement. This ensures a consistent interface across multiple classes, promoting code uniformity and readability.\n2.Polymorphism:\n\nInterface classes contribute to achieving polymorphism by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common interface type. This enables more flexible and extensible code designs.\n3.Code Organization:\n\nInterface classes help organize code by clearly defining the expected behavior of classes that implement them. This separation of concerns makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.\n4.Use of abc Module:\n\nThe abc module in Python is commonly used to create interface classes. The ABC (Abstract Base Class) metaclass, along with the @abstractmethod decorator, facilitates the creation of abstract methods within an interface.\"\"\"\n#8.

Explain the significance of encapsulation in achieving abstraction. Provide examples.\n\n\"\"\"\n1.Data Hiding \n- Encapsulation allows the building of data within a class and restricts access to the internal details of an object.\nThis is known as data hiding, and it helps in preventing direct manipulation of the object's internal state by external code.\n2.Implementation hiding \n- Encapsulation allows for hiding the internal implementation details of a class.\nExternal code  interacts with the class through a well -defined interface, reducing dependencies and making it easier to modify the internal implementation without affecting external code.\n\n3.Abstraction through interface \n-Encapsulation facilitates the creation of well-defined interfaces for classes,providing a level of abstraction.\nExternal code interacts with the class through public methos,abstracting away the internal details.\n\"\"\"\n\n#example - \n\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self,make,model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.__engine_status = \"off\"\n    def start_engine(self):\n        self.__engine_status = \"On\"\n\n    def stop_engine(self):\n        self.__engine_status = \"off\"\n\nmy_car = Car(\"Toyota\",\"Camry\")\nmy_car.start_engine()\n#10. What is the purpose of abstract methods, and how do they enforce abstraction in Python classes?\n\n\"\"\"Abstract methods in python are methods declared in an abstract base class (ABC) using the @abstracrtmethod decorator but they do not provide an implementation.\nTheir purpose is to serve as a blueprint for subclasses ,ensuring  that all derived classes must procvide their own implementation for these abstract methosds.\n\nPurpose of abstract method\n1.Define a common interface \nAbstract method allow you to  define a common set of methods that must be implemented by all concrete subclasses.\nThis helps establish a consistent interface for a group of related classes.\n\n2.Force subclasses to provide implementation \n-Subclasses that inherit from an abstract base class are required to implement all the abstracrt methods declared in that class.This ensures that each subclass provides its own specific implementation,promotinf code consistency.\n\n3.Enforce Design Contracts \n-Abstract methods help enforce design contracts, ensuring that certain methods are availaible in all subclasses.\nThis is especially useful in scenarios where a shared interface or behavior is expected across multiple classes.\n\nHOW ABSTRACT METHDS ENFORCE ABSTRACTION \n1.Template for subclasses:\n-Abstract method act as a template or blueprint for subclass.They define the expected methods that subclasses must implement but leave the implementation details to the individual subclasses.\n\n2.Runtime Checks :\n-If a subclass fails to provide an implementation  for any abstract method ,attempting to instantiate an object of that subclass will result in a typeerror .\nThis runtime checls enforces that all abstract methods are implemented before the class can be instantiated .\n\n3.Forces Subclass Specificity \n-Abstract method forces subclass to be specific about their  implementation details.This specificity helps in  achieving  a higher level of abstraction by allowing the base class to define the overall structure while leaving the detailed behaviour to the subclass.\n\"\"\"\n#11.

How can you encapsulate and hide the details of composed objects in Python classes to maintain abstraction?\n\n\"\"\"Encapsulation is a fundamenal principle of oop and it involves bundling the data(attributes) and the method that operate on the data into a single unit,\noften referred to as a class.IN the context of composed objects,encapsulation helps in hide the internal details of the objects,promoting abstraction and allowing changes to the implementation without affecting the rest of the code.\n\n1.Use Private Attributes\n-Declare attributes as private by prefixing them with a double underscore .This convention makes the attribute harder to access from outside the class,\neffictively encapsulating them.\n\n2.Provide public method\n-Create public method that act as interface with the composed objects.\nThese methods encapsulate the internal details and provide a clear way to internal with the object.\n\n3.Hide complex logic \n-If the coresponds objects have complex logic or interactions,encapsulae that logic within the class methods.\nThe external code only needs to call these methods without knowing the intricate details.\n\n4.Use Getters and Setters \n-if you need to expose certain attributes but want control over access or modification ,use getters and setters.This allow you to encapsulate the attribute acess and modification logic.\n\"\"\"\n#12.

Discuss the challenges and drawbacks of composition, such as increased complexity and potential for tight coupling between objects.\n\n\"\"\"Drawbacks --->\n1.Increased Complexity \n-Composition can lead to increased complexity , especially in systems with deep hierarchies of composed objects.\nManaging the relationships and interactions between various components can become intricate.\n\n2.Potential for tight coupling \n-Although composition is intended to promote loose coupling, improper design can lead to tight coupling between objects .\nIf one object relies heavily on the internal details of another object,changes in one component may require modifications in others,defeating the purpose of composition.\n\n3.Boilerplate Code \n-As you compose more objects ,you may fine yourself writing boilerplate code to delegate method calls or manage interactions between components.This can result in redundant code that may be error- prone and harder to maintain .\n\n4.Dependency Management\n-Mananging dependencies between objects can become challenging .If a component relies on multiple other components,ensuring that they are all availaible and properly initialized can be a non-trivial task.\n\"\"\"\n#14.

Explain how composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs.\n\n\"\"\"\nCompositio enhance code maintainability and modularity in python programs by promoting a design approach that amphasize building complex systems from smaller,independent components.\n\n1.Modularity \n-Composition allows you to break down a system into smaller,self-contained modules or components.\nEach component focuses on a specific  aspect of functionality ,making the codebase modular and easier to understand.\n\n2.Code Reusability \n-With composition ,individuals components can be reused in different contexts.\nThis is particularly beneficial when you have well -defined ,reusable pieces of functionality that can be leverged across multiple parts of your program or even in diggerent projects.\n\n3.Encapsulation \n-Composition encourages encapsulation,which is the building of data and functionality into a  single unit .The internal details of a component are hidden from the outside world,\npromoting a clear interface and reducing the risk of unintended interference.\n\n4.Flexibility and Extensibility\n-Components created through composition are typically designed with clear interfaces.\nThis makes it easier to modify or extend the system without affecting other parts of the code.\nNew components can be added ,and existing ones can be modified without causing ripples effects throuhout the entire codebase.\n\n5.Ease of testing \n-Individuals components can be tested independently,allowing for more focused and effective testing .This is particularly advantageous in unit testing,where you can isolate and test each module in isolation ,ensuring that it functions correctly before integrating it into the larger system.\n\"\"\"\n#16.

Describe the concept of \"aggregation\" in composition and how it differs from simple composition.\n\n\"\"\"\nComposition \n-In composition , one class contains an instance of  another class and  is responsible for the creation and destruction of the contained objects.\nThis means that the contained object is a part  of the whole, and when the containig object is destroyed ,the contained object is also destroyed.\ncomposition is often used when there is a strong  has-a relationship between the containnig and contained objects.\n\nAggregation \n-Aggregation ,on the other hand ,is a more loosely coupled relationship .It occurs when one class contains another class, but the contained object has an independent lifecycle and can exit without the containing object.\nThe contained object is not fully owned by the containig object,and it can be shared among multiple containing objects .\n\"\"\"\n#18.

How can you achieve flexibility in composed objects by allowing them to be replaced or modified dynamically at runtime?\n\n\"\"\"\nUsing Interfaces or Abstract classes:\nDefine interfaces or abstract classes for the components that can be composed.\nThis allows for the interchangeability of different implementations.Clients interact with these components through their interfaces,making ita easy to replace or modify implementation at runtime.\n\n2.Dependency Injection \nUse dependency injection to provide components to an object at runtime.This way,you can easily replace or modify the components without modify the object's code  .\nThis enhances the flexibility of the composed object.\n3.Decorator Pattern \nUse the decorator pattern to dynamically add or replace responsibility of objects.\nThis allows you to stack multiple decorators on an object,and each decorator can modify the behaviour of add functionality .\n\n\"\"\"\n#20.
